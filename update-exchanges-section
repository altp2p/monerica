On the page, when one clicks on exchanges, there is Changelly - see: report, which has a strike through. 
Additionally, Freewallet - see: report also has a strike through. 
However, both reports go to https://old.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/
Is there a problem with Frewallet? If so, kindly update the report.
